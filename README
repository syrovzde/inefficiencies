All of the file sources for finding and calculating arbitrage bets

There is tutorial.ipnb  notebook where program can be tested
  - Requires Gurobi lincence, there is a CTU licence available:
  - Here is a guide to get the licence https://cw.fel.cvut.cz/b222/_media/courses/ko/gurobi_installation_guide_2023.pdf from combinatorial course
  - Plus all of the imported used python libraries


In terms of code majority of functions are related to the database or parsing of strings.
The important functions are:
  - Arbitrage_profit in file arbitrage_main.py which is a function that takes all the parameters in the thesis and runs one concrete test and returns profits
  - The program formulations are in arbitrage.py as create_model and create_weighted_model functions.
  - Mapping between strings is in mapping.py
  - Poisson-related functions in Poisson.py

Only tutorial.ipnb and shown example can be run(parameters of function arbitrage_profit_tutorial can still be changed with the exception of points=11)
The test is run on a few matchids that were chosen from ones that yield some results.

Rest cannot be run, because it is connected to database.
